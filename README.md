# In-Silico Functional Characterization of a Hypothetical Bacterial Protein

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete bioinformatics pipeline for the functional characterization of an unannotated protein sequence using computational methods.

The workflow mirrors standard approaches used in biological research, including sequence validation, homology searching, and functional inference.

## Dataset
- Organism: Mesobacillus selenatarsenatis
- Protein length: 201 amino acids
- Annotation status: Hypothetical protein

## Methods
- Sequence parsing and analysis using Biopython
- Sequence quality assessment and validation
- Homology search using BLASTP
- Functional annotation based on conserved domains (DUF4253)
- Biological interpretation and limitations analysis

## Key Findings
- The protein is highly conserved across multiple bacterial species
- Strong BLAST homology indicates membership in the DUF4253 protein family
- While the exact function remains unknown, conservation suggests an important biological role

## Limitations
This analysis is based solely on sequence similarity and does not include experimental validation.

## Technologies
- Python
- Biopython
- NCBI BLAST
- Jupyter Notebooks
