# Functional Sequence Characterization

This project performs an in-silico functional characterization of a hypothetical bacterial protein using a single continuous bioinformatics pipeline.

## Pipeline Steps
1. Sequence retrieval
2. Sequence quality analysis
3. Sequence filtering & validation
4. Homology search (BLAST)
5. Functional annotation
6. Biological interpretation

Each step is documented and executed in a dedicated Jupyter notebook.
